South Bay Naturals - Interactive Market Analysis Dashboard

This project is a single-page interactive web application designed to present a comprehensive market analysis for "South Bay Naturals." It transforms a dense, text-based report into an intuitive and engaging dashboard, allowing users to easily explore, understand, and synthesize key market data, consumer insights, and strategic recommendations.

The application is built with vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Chart.js for data visualization, structured into separate HTML, CSS, and JS files for maintainability.

    Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

    Dynamic Navigation: The sidebar navigation automatically highlights the active section as the user scrolls, and clicking a link smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
